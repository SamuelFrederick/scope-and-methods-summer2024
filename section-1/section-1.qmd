## Installing R and RStudio

- Navigate to https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
  - Can also just search for RStudio Desktop

- Follow the download instructions
  1. Download R
  2. Download RStudio

## Working Directories

- **Important!** 

- Create a folder for this course on your computer

- Give it a short and meaningful title (e.g., Scope and Methods)

- Store your data, R files, and any other helpful info from the course in it

- Know where it is located (i.e., know the path)

## Working Directories

Example Paths to Folders:

- Mac:
  - "/Users/samfrederick/Desktop/Scope and Methods"
  - "~/Desktop/Scope and Methods"
  
- Windows:
  - "C://Users/samfrederick/Desktop/Scope and Methods"

## Working Directories

- Depending on your preferences, you can:
  - Specify the path to your file manually
  - Set your working directory manually
  - Use an RProject and associate it with your course folder

## Manual Path Specification

- Not recommended 
  - lengthy, error-prone, not very replicable

- Write out full path of file:
  - e.g., "/Users/samfrederick/Desktop/Scope and Methods/file.csv"

## Setting Working Directory Manually

- Better but still can have issues with replication and lengthiness

- Use the R command setwd() to specify the "working directory"
  - i.e., your course folder
  - Only need to do this once in a given R session
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("/Users/samfrederick/Desktop/Scope and Methods/")
```

## RProjects

- Best method

- "File" > 
      "New Project" > 
          "Existing Directory" > 
              "Browse" > 
                  "Create Project"

- Only need to open project to access your files

## RScript

- As (social) scientists, we want our work to be reproducible

- Important to save work such that another person could follow your exact steps and would get the same results

- Use RScript files to write and save code
  - Like Word documents, but for R code

## RScript: Running Code

- command + return on a Mac or control + Enter on a Windows

![](rscript_run.png)

## RMarkdown

- Similar to RScript files 

- But also allows you to include text

- Produces good output for Problem Sets

## RMarkdown

![](rscript1.png)

. . . 

![](rmd1.png)

## RMarkdown

- Select HTML or Word (have to install LaTeX to use PDF)

## RMarkdown

## RMarkdown Advice

- Knit your RMarkdown frequently (i.e., at each step of creation)

- Often small errors can cause issues 
  - And can be hard to catch otherwise

## RMarkdown Practice

- Open RStudio

- Try to open a new RMarkdown document

- Which parts of the document seem to include R code? 

- See if you can figure out how to insert a new code chunk (a section that R reads as code)

## RMarkdown: Running Code

- command + return on a Mac or control + Enter on a Windows

## Intro to Coding in R

Arithmetic:

- Addition: +

- Subtraction: - 

- Multiplication: *

- Division: /

- Exponents: x^y (x to the power of y)

## Intro to Coding in R: Practice

- Go to R and open an RScript file

- Set your working directory to your course folder by writing out code in the RScript

. . . 

```{r, eval = F}
setwd("/Users/samfrederick/Desktop/Scope and Methods")
```

## Intro to Coding in R

What is the output of the following lines of code?

```{r, eval = F}
2+2
2+2-3
2+2-3*4
2+2-3*4/6
(2+2-3*4/6)^3
```
. . . 

```{r, eval = T}
2+2
2+2-3
2+2-3*4
2+2-3*4/6
(2+2-3*4/6)^3
```

## Functions in R

Standard format: 

- functionname(argumentname = argument)

Function help:

- Type "?functionname" and run that line of code
  - Help page will pop up in the "Help" pane
  
  . . . 
  
  - Help pages usually have overviews of the function, descriptions of key     arguments, outputs, and example code

## Basic Functions

- Addition: `sum()`
  - e.g., `sum(1, 2)`

- Average: `mean()` 

- Square Root: `sqrt()` 

- Minimum: `min()`; Maximum: `max()`

## Basic Functions

Try running the following code:

```{r, eval =T}
9+8+157.5
```

How would you calculate this value using an R function? 

What is the average of these three numbers?

## Basic Functions: Vectors

- Concatenate: `c()` (turns a comma separated list of numbers into a vector)
  - Vectors of numbers can be passed to functions 

```{r}
mean(c(1,2,3))
```

- Determine length of vector: `length()`

- Return unique items in vector: `unique()`

## More Functions and Operators

- `begin:end`: creates a vector containing the sequence of integers from begin to end

- `seq(a, b, by = c)`: creates a vector containing the sequence of integers from a to b in steps of size c

```{r}
1:3
seq(1,3, by = 1)
mean(seq(2, 20, by = 2))
```


## Assignment Operator

- `x <- y`: assign y to object x

```{r}
x <- 1:5
mean(x)
sum(x)
y <- sum(x)
y
```

## Loading Data into R

- Mostly work with csv files (similar to Excel spreadsheets)

- Load with some variant of `read.csv()` function

- This is where setting your working directory becomes important 

```{r, eval = F}
data <- read.csv("example_data.csv")
```

- Data loaded in as a data.frame object in R
  - Columns are variables and rows are individual observations

## Recap

- Set working directory to course folder:
  - `setwd(path/to/course folder)`
  - Use an RProject associated with course folder
  
- Write (and save) code in RScripts or RMarkdown files
  - Knit RMarkdown files frequently after changes to catch bugs in code early
  - RMarkdown will be *super* helpful for problem sets
